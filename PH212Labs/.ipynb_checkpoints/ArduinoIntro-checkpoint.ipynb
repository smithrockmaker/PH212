In the next lab we will spend some time exploring and understanding the general structure of an Arduino sketch. For this week  we are mostly getting our tools in order and making sure we can get everything to work. There are only two commands that we are looking to understand this week. They are the digitalWrite() and delay() commands. Read through the reference pages that are linked just for the experience. Can you make sense of the information? Are there interesting comments in the warning sections?\n",
