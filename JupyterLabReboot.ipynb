    "So....it's been a few months since most of us worked consistently with Jupyter notebooks. For this first lab it seemed like a good approach would be to ask you to do something very similar to a lab we did in PH211. In the Rock Drop Lab you entered some data, plotted it, did a polynomial fit to that data, and finally plotted the data and the fit on a single graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "What I am going to set up here is a small subset of those operations except that I will give you a different set of data \n",
    "\n",
    "As I started into this I had my usual burst of enthusiasm for what you could get done and after working on this for several hours myself I realized I'd be wise to dial it back. Those of you who want to explore further can take on the JupyterLabRebootXT (extended version)\n",
    "\n",
    " I have zoom office hours scheduled on Monday from 11-12 and I can set up some additional time in the afternoon if you email me. Be ready to share your work via zoom if we are chatting about this.\n",

    "Here's the github Rock Drop Lab: [PH211 Repo: Rock Drop Lab](https://github.com/smithrockmaker/PH211/blob/master/RockDropLab.ipynb)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that it's a bit of a pain to copy and paste each cell from the github so if you still have the lab you created in PH211 it would be easier to modify that.\n",
